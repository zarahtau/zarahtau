# Hi there! 👋
I'm Zarah, a Computer Engineering student passionate about exploring both the software and hardware aspects of technology!

## About Me 💻
I'm a self-motivated C++ enthusiast, constantly seeking new challenges to enhance my skills. Currently, I'm diving into the exciting world of SQL, adding another layer to my skill set.

In addition to my coding journey, I'm currently interning at MIPS technologies as a CPU Performance modeling intern. Before, I engaged in fascinating research at Anwar Labs, UC Berkeley, where I focused on pioneering advancements in real-time multicellularity for personalized medicine.

**✨My Goal✨** 

Use code to drive innovation and progress in our ever-evolving world! Whether it's tinkering with Python to test components or working on projects with C++, I'm always eager to make a meaningful impact.
